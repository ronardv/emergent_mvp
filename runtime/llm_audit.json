    "response": "1. Risk Detection:\n- The system snapshot shows the stage as ANALYZE and task as \"Test task,\" but there is no specific plan or diff provided. This lack of detailed plan or change requests may pose a risk of insufficient guidance or missed critical steps.\n- Absence of diff information limits the ability to assess potential side effects or conflicts, increasing the risk of unforeseen issues.\n\n2. Plan/Diff Review:\n- The plan is marked as N/A; no concrete steps or strategy are outlined.\n- The diff field is also N/A, indicating no changes or modifications are specified for review.\n- This absence hinders thorough evaluation and validation of intended actions.\n\n3. Performance Estimation:\n- Without a defined plan or diff, it's challenging to estimate performance impact.\n- The task is labeled as a test, which might imply limited scope and minimal resource usage.\n- However, lack of specifics prevents accurate assessment of expected system responsiveness, completion time, or resource consumption.\n\n4. Text-only Suggestions:\n- Specify a clear, detailed plan outlining the objectives, procedures, and expected outcomes for the task.\n- Provide a diff or change log to enable review of modifications and potential risks.\n- Include performance benchmarks or estimates to help anticipate resource requirements and completion timelines.\n- Incorporate risk mitigation strategies based on the planned actions.\n- Ensure that subsequent snapshots include comprehensive data to facilitate effective analysis and decision-making.",
